The additional special tile I plan to implement is called zeroTile. If this tile is triggered, the score of current player in this turn will become zero.

Instructions:
-If you want to play tiles on the board, click the letter tile or special tile
-Then click a location on the board where you would like to play
-Before you click 'Play' button,'Pass' button or 'Exchange' button
-You can click 'Retrieve' button at any time to undo all placement in this turn
-After you confirmed your placement, click 'Play' button
-If these placements are invalid, it will automatically retrieve all placements
-If you want to exchange some letter tiles, click all the letter tiles you want to exchange
-If you clicked some letter tiles before but you would like to exchange other tiles instead of these
-Click 'Retrieve' button to empty all choosed tiles, then re-choose
-Click 'Pass' button to pass this turn
-If all players choose 'Pass', game end
-If there are less than 7 letter tiles in the tile bag, game end
